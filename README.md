# Coder - an experimentation platform for Raspberry Pi

### What Is Coder
Coder is a free piece of software that turns a Raspberry Pi into a super simple platform that educators and parents can use to teach the basics of building for the web. With Coder, kids learn to program by building apps in HTML, CSS, and Javascript right from their web browser.

### How It Works
With a Coder SD card installed, your Raspberry Pi will start the Coder web server on boot. You can then configure and program your Raspberry Pi via a web browser by visiting http://coder.local from your local network.

### How To Install
To install Coder, see the end-user documentation at http://g.co/coder
